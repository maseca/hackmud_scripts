# hackmud_scripts
I began playing the online game Hackmud as a way to familiarize myself with JavaScript.
Most of the scripts featured heavily use game API and are not intended to be usable elsewhere such as in a browser.
Many of the scripts are used for unlocking complex automation puzzles, but some are just artistic and serve no practical purpose in the game.
Some of the included scripts borrow heavily from the source of other in-game users, but for the most part it is my own original code.

It should be noted as well that "maseca" and "sp4c3b0y" refer to the scripts of two unique in-game characters that I play as and switch between frequently.
